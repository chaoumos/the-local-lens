This website is dedicated to hyper-local discovery, featuring user-generated reviews, photos, and stories about businesses, attractions, and hidden gems in towns and cities worldwide. The site needs a prominent search function, map integration (using Leaflet or similar), and a robust review system. Focus on a clean, modern design with a strong emphasis on visual content. Key sections include: Browse (by location), Discover (curated lists), and Contribute (user submissions). Target audience: Travelers and locals seeking authentic experiences.</p>
